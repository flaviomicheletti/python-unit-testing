"""
You're right that both examples achieve the same thing - they replace the requests.get 
function with a mock that returns a successful response with a JSON payload.

The main difference between the two approaches is in how the mock function is used. 
In the first example, a custom mock function is defined and then passed to 
requests.get.side_effect. This sets the side effect of requests.get to the custom function,
meaning that every call to requests.get within the get_holidays function will use the 
custom function to return a response.

In the second example, the mock function is defined in the same way, but it is not passed directly
to requests.get. Instead, its reference is set as the value of requests.get. This means that
any call to requests.get within the test case will return the mock function directly, 
rather than using the original requests.get function.

In terms of which approach is better, it really depends on the specific use case. In general,
using requests.get.side_effect is more flexible and allows you to define a different response
for each call to requests.get, which can be useful in some cases. On the other hand, setting 
the value of requests.get directly can be simpler and more straightforward, especially if you 
only need to define a single response for all calls to requests.get.

In either case, it's important to remember to reset the original requests.get function or
its side effect to their original state after the test is complete, to avoid affecting other
tests or code that may rely on them.
